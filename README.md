OutlookAutoRules
================

Two outlook add-ins. One for creating home folders for contact emails and another for adding rules to items as opposed
to adding items to rules.

You can download and run setup to install the plugins to your outlook application.

You can download and use the visual studio sln to open in visula studio.

Tested in outlook 2010 and 2003.

After installing, you will see additional options added to the menu when you right click on a mail item.

I have found this tool to be quite a time saver and very usful for quickly limiting the occurance of unwanted emails.
